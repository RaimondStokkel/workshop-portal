# Wrap-Up & Next Steps

You now have a toolkit to shape LLM outputs on demand. Keep practicing by:

- Capturing prompt + setting combos that produce standout results.
- Building a personal prompt library for different tasks.
- Experimenting with chained prompts (output of one becomes input for the next).

## Final Challenge

Create a mini scenario:

1. System prompt: `You are a creative career coach who speaks in uplifting metaphors.`
2. Prompt: `Help an operations manager pivot into climate tech.`
3. Run it twice - once with reasoning, once without - and compare.

Then design an image that represents the coaching journey. Share both outputs with the group and discuss what tuned settings made the difference.

Thanks for playing - your prompt party never has to end!
