# Prompting Essentials

LLMs thrive on clarity. Three pillars keep your prompts sturdy:

| Pillar | Why it matters | Quick win |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role & goal | Gives the model context | Start with "You are..." |
| Desired output | Sets format & tone | Mention bullets, length, or style |
| Constraints | Keeps answers on track | Include boundaries or examples |

## Try It

Paste this into the playground, then adjust the temperature from **0.2** to **0.8** to sense the change:

```
You are a tour guide. Create a 3-stop walking tour for someone who loves unexpected local art.
```

Observe what happens to specificity, creativity, and structure.

## Remix

- Swap "tour guide" with another role.
- Ask for a different output format (haiku, checklist, story arc).
- Add a constraint like "Keep each stop under 40 words."
