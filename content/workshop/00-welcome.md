# Welcome to the Prompt Party

Welcome aboard! This workshop is your playground for learning how to steer large language models (LLMs) like a pro. We will:

- Demystify system prompts, temperature, and top-p.
- Compare reasoning-capable models with non-reasoning ones.
- Craft images from imagination.
- Build playful experiments that you can repeat with your own ideas.

## How It Works

1. Pick a module from the list to the left.
2. Read the brief lesson, try the exercises, and launch experiments in the playground.
3. Remix the prompts, capture your favorite results, and share them with the group.

Throughout the workshop you will see **Try It** callouts. Copy those prompts into the playground and tweak the settings to feel the difference. Have fun and take notes - LLM skills compound quickly!
