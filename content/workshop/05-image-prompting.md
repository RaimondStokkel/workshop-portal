# Image Prompting Playground

Text-to-image models love vivid ingredients:

1. **Subject** - Who or what is the focus?
2. **Style** - Illustration, watercolor, cinematic photo?
3. **Details** - Lighting, mood, setting, props.
4. **Constraints** - Aspect ratio, color palette, realism.

## Try It

1. Enter this prompt in the image creator: `A cozy reading nook with warm string lights, watercolor illustration.`
2. Generate an image, then refine the prompt with more detail.
3. Switch to a minimalistic design style and compare.

## Remix Ideas

- Mix genres: `retro-futuristic botanical garden`
- Set a mood: `stormy, high-contrast lighting`
- Focus on composition: `top-down perspective`

Save your favorite prompts - they make excellent reference material for future creative sprints.
