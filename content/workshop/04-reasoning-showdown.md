# Reasoning Showdown

Reasoning-capable models take extra steps before answering. They excel when problems need structured thinking or multi-step plans.

## Side-by-Side Drill

1. Turn **Reasoning** on with medium effort.
2. Ask: `Design a 3-day onboarding plan for a junior data analyst joining a healthcare startup.`
3. Observe the answer, then disable reasoning and run it again.

Look for:

- Numbered steps vs loose paragraphs
- References to constraints ("healthcare regulations")
- Whether assumptions are stated explicitly

## When to Enable Reasoning

- Planning, scheduling, or decision trees
- Chain-of-thought explanations for audits
- Code walkthroughs or debugging help

## Keep in Mind

Reasoning runs may take longer and consume more tokens. Use them when quality beats speed.
