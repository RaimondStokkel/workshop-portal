# System Prompts: Setting the Stage

The **system prompt** whispers rules into the model's ear before the conversation begins. It is perfect for:

- Locking in persona ("You are a patient mentor..."
- Defining etiquette ("Always ask clarifying questions before answering.")
- Enforcing guardrails ("Refuse to guess if data is missing.")

## Experiment

1. Set the system prompt to: `You are a meticulous editor who never uses jargon.`
2. Ask for a summary of your favorite book.
3. Toggle the system prompt off and hit **Generate Text** again.

Spot the differences in vocabulary, structure, and confidence. System prompts act like professional lighting for your prompt - it makes everything sharper.

## Challenge

- Create a system prompt that keeps responses playful but factual.
- Combine role, tone, and guardrails in one line.
- Compare reasoning vs non-reasoning runs with the same system prompt.
